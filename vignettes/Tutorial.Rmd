#First thing - how to install the package. Syntax:

```{r}
devtools::install_github("brittanymaldonado/maldonadopackage")
```

#Next - reminder to load package. 

```{r}
library(maldonadopackage)
```

## Function 1 - Formatting dates and creating "Year" column

#Do you have a long-term dataset with many observations? Would you like to format your data in a way that allows easy visualization of year-to-year trends? Then this is the function for you! The dataset you input only needs to have a "Date" column in the following format: MM/DD/YYYY. This function is ideal for long-term datasets with observations across years or many observations per month. What do you get out of it? A column, "Year," that pulls the year for each observation out of the date.


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(assertthat)
library(lubridate)
file_path <- system.file("extdata", "agpdata.csv", package="maldonadopackage")
agp <- read.csv(file_path)
agp_by_yr <- yearify(agp)
agp_by_yr
```
